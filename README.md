# UTTwitchHype
Twitch IRC bot that lets you place wagers on games

You will need to edit DefaultTwitchHype.ini with your custom settings. Plugin config merging doesn't seem to work right, if you have settings that aren't updating, you need to delete TwitchHype.ini out of your Saved game directory.

I made a special account for my bot, but he still joins #petenub
